# PlinkoGame
- Slot machine like game

<h1>Technologies used</h1>
- Javascript (testing and final export)
- Typescript (main codebase)
- PixiJS (rendering the game in browser)

<h1>Issues</h1>
- Import art assets to build the game world
- Apply physics to the player ball (collisions and collision tracking with other objects)
- Apply physics to the rest of the world objects (pins and score buckets)
- Implement score system:
    - Deduct 10 from original 100 player points for dropping
    - Increase score for landing in bucket
    - Algorithm to guide player to pre-determined bucket.
